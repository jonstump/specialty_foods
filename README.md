```

* If you would like to see the code use the command "editor ." (where editor is your code editor. example code for VScode and vim for Vim) to open the project in your code editor.

```

* You will need to use rails in order to setup the databases for the project along with Postgres installed on your machine as well. To install the databases and tables run the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
rake db:create

``` bash
rails c
```
once this has pulled up the rails console you can create an admin user by pasting in the folling:
```ruby
User.create!(
    email: 'superman@krpyton.com',
    password: 'admin123',
    admin: true
)
```

## To dos
